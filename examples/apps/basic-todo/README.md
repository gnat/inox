# Basic ToDo App

Note: The application uses [HTMX](https://htmx.org/), and a [custom HTMX extension](../../docs/frontend-development.md#forms) for converting form parameters to JSON. The current state of the code is not yet representative of all the features that Inox will provide. Also please note that 
this is a limited application example.
