# [Inclusion Imports] 

manifest {}

# An inclusion import includes the content of a file in the current module.
# Inclusion imports are useful to decompose a module or regroup pattern definitions 
# and functions shared between modules.
# In order to be includable a file should start with the `includable-file` keyword:

import /.tutorial-files/schema.ix

print("CONST_FROM_FILE:", CONST_FROM_FILE)
print("pattern from the included file:", %user)

function_from_file()
