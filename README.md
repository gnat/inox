üõ°Ô∏è Inox is your **shield** against complexity in full-stack development.

The Inox platform is released as a **single binary** that will contain all you need to develop, test, and deploy web apps that are primarily rendered server-side. Applications are developped using **Inoxlang**, a sandboxed programming language that 
deeply integrates with Inox's built-in database engine, testing engine and HTTP server.

**The first stable versions of Inox won't support high scalability applications**

<details>

**<summary>üéØ Goals</summary>**

- Zero boilerplate
- Dead simple configuration
- Super stable (_once version 1.0 is reached_)
- Secure by default
- Low maintenance
- A programming language as simple as possible

</details>


## Questions You May Have

<details>

**<summary>Why isn't Inox using a container runtime such as Docker ?</summary>**

Because the long term goal of Inox is to be a **simple**, single-binary and **super stable** platform for applications written in Inoxlang
and using libraries compiled to WASM.\
Each application or service will ultimately run in a separate process:
- filesystem isolation is achieved by using virtual filesystems (meta filesystem)
- process-level access control will be achieved using [Landlock](https://landlock.io/)
- fine-grained module-level access control is already achieved by Inox's permission system
- process-level resource allocation and limitation will be implemented using cgroups
- module-level resource allocation and limitation is performed by Inox's limit system

</details>

<details>

**<summary>What is the state of the codebase (quality, documentation, tests) ?</summary>**

As of now, certain parts of the codebase are not optimally written, lack sufficient comments and documentation, and do not have robust test coverage. The first version (0.1) being now released, I will dedicate 20-30% of my working time to improving the overall quality, documentation, and test coverage of the codebase.

</details>


**<summary>üöß Planned Features</summary>**
- CSS and JS Bundling
- Encryption of secrets and database data
- Storage of secrets in key management services (e.g. GCP KMS, AWS KMS)
- Version Control System (Git) for projects using https://github.com/go-git/go-git 
- Database backup in S3 (compatible) storage
- Database with persistence in S3 and on-disk cache
- Log persistence in S3
- WebAssembly support using https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero.
- Team management and access control
- ... [other planned features](./FUTURE.md)

Inox applications can currently only be developed using the Inox extension for VSCode and VSCodium.
You can install the inox binary on your local (Linux) machine, local VM, or a remote machine.

<details>

**<summary>Installation Instructions</summary>**

- Download the latest release
  ```
  wget -N https://github.com/inoxlang/inox/releases/latest/download/inox-linux-amd64.tar.gz && tar -xvf inox-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ```

- Install `inox` to `/usr/local/bin`
  ```
  sudo install ./inox -o root -m 0755 /usr/local/bin/inox
  ```

- Delete the files that are no longer needed
  ```
  rm ./inox inox-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ```

<!-- - __\[recommended\]__ add the [inoxd daemon](./docs/inox-daemon.md) (systemd service) to automatically start the project server.
  If you have installed `inox` on your **local machine** or a local VM, you can execute the following command to add **inoxd**:
  ```
  sudo inox add-service # don't run this on a REMOTE machine
  ```
  _If you execute this command inside a VM, don't forget to forward the port 8305 to allow VSCode to connect to the project server._ -->

- __Add Inox support to your IDE__
  - [VSCode & VSCodium](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=graphr00t.inox) : LSP, debug, colorization, snippets, formatting.\
    **‚ö†Ô∏è Once the extension is installed make sure to read the Requirements and Usage sections in the extension's details.**

- __\[optional\]__ install command completions for the current user
  ```
  inox install-completions
  ```

If you want to build Inox from source go [here](#build-from-source).

## Application Examples

- [Basic Todo app](./examples/apps/basic-todo-app.md)

_More examples will be added soon._

## Learning Inox

You can learn Inox directly in VSCode by creating a file with a `.tut.ix` extension. This is the recommended way.
**Make sure to create this file inside an Inox project.**

<details>
<summary>Scripting</summary>

Inox can be used for scripting & provides a shell. The development of the
language in those domains is not very active because Inox primarily focuses on
Web Application Development.

To learn scripting go [here](./docs/scripting-basics.md). View
[Shell Basics](./docs/shell-basics.md) to learn how to use Inox interactively.
